# Mental Health Wellbeing

## Steps taken
1. The first iteration of the site was done without any real planning, at least in as much as no wireframes or set agenda. 
   I quickly saw the error of this as I decided that a lot of my images were dour. Although the subject covers depression
   I didn't want people who visit the site to not have a pleasant first impression so I decided to completely restart.

2. I watched the class on wireframing with balsamiq and so I felt I could carry out the task using this software, I will 
   attach the finished images to this readme.md file.

3. I chose some images from a free stock image website that I thought showed Mental Health support rather than suffering.

4. I converted the images to ".webp" files from jpeg/png as I was told this file format works best for website 
   compression and therefore download speed.

5. I chose a colour scheme based on the wireframe software and amended it to suit my needs.

6. After too long spent on trying to create fixed headers and footers I stripped the site back to its bare boilerplate 
   code without any styling so that I could effectively start from scratch.

7. I copied in some code from a site I had created on another course to amend to suit the basic frame of each page in
   order that I could add in the specifics later.
